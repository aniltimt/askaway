  %strong What is Ask Away?
  %br
  Ask Away is a website where Kiwis ask the parties questions during the election, and you can answer them on behalf of your party. Ask Away is part of Massey University’s Design and Democracy Project, which aims to facilitate youth engagement in the 2014 General Election.
%p
  %strong Which questions should you answer?
  %br
  You can answer any question you like. Just bear in mind that your party can only give one answer to each question, so think about whether you’re the best person from your party to be answering.

%p
  We’ll email you if there are really popular questions you need to answer. Depending on how many people in your party are answering questions, you can expect to get one or two reminder emails per week.
%p
  If you have any questions, free to email me, meg@askaway.org.nz, or call me with any questions.

  Warm regards,
