            %h3 About Ask Away
            %p Ask Away is a Q &amp; A website where New Zealanders can ask the parties questions in the lead up to the elections. It’s an easy way to find out the parties’ positions on issues, and to compare their views side by side. It’s also a way for you to make your voice heard this election, and get the parties talking about the things that are important to you.
